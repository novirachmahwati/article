# Article Web Service

## Introduction
HelloðŸ‘‹, my name is Novi Rachmahwati. This project is developed as part of the Backend Developer Technical Test for Sagala company.

## Project Description
This web service provides an API for creating and retrieving articles. It has been designed to manage high traffic loads by incorporating Redis caching. The use of Redis helps mitigate performance issues that can arise from sudden surges in request volume.


## Features
- **Create New Articles**: Allows users to add new articles with details such as author, title, and body.
- **Retrieve Articles**: Fetches a list of articles with support for optional query parameters to search by keyword and filter by author.
- **Caching with Redis**: Uses Redis to cache frequently accessed data, enhancing performance and handling spikes in traffic effectively.


## Technologies Used
- PHP (Version 8.3.9)
- Laravel Framework (Version 11.1.3)
- Redis
- Composer
- MySQL
